# Drone signature classification
solution to https://github.com/Marchev-Science/case-drone-signature-classification

## 1. The tasks we had
Use the provided CardRF dataset to solve the following tasks:
1. Extract characteristic features for every UAV, distinguishing it from the others.
2. Use the features to classify (through multi-class model) to determine the type of UAV.
3. Use the features to determine which activities the UAV is doing.
4. Distinguish LOS/NLOS.

## 2. The CardRF Dataset
